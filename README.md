This week was compilation of the commercial in C#,Go,Java,Elixir .

C# manage to include more methods and functions using Visual Studio .

Go was built with just one scenario but everything is working !

Java an adventure more at least I learn more a language for example 

-System.out.println in C# is Console.WriteLine.

Elixir is a much more complex language but I will try to do the minimum 
so that I know more about it
